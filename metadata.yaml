description: This classic guide teaching the reader the techniques of singing was
  written by a professional opera singer - Lilli Lehman - over 100 years ago. It has
  since become a must-read book for all those wishing to expand their vocal talents,
  and teaches a range of skills which the amateur singer often overlooks. Miss Lehmann
  was born in Germany in 1848 and went on to become a soprano of phenomenal versatility
  and in later years a voice teacher of much acclaim. Miss Lehmann sung her way around
  europe appearing in most of the leading opera houses - her voice was her passport.
  Looking at her presence on.
